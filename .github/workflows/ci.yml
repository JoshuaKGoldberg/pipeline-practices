            _Frequently Asked Questions ‚ùî_

            <details>
              <summary>Why do I see this message?</summary>

              We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as our JavaScript [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29), and run it as part of CI workflow for each PR. It found some errors in this PR's branch.
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>One of the files with lint errors is autogenerated. What should I do?</summary>

              You have a few options:
              - if you want to ignore the errors and you can access the code generator's source or configuration, you can add an `/* eslint-disable */` comment to the top of the file. This is what [unplugin/unplugin-auto-import](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-auto-import/blob/main/test/__snapshots__/dts.test.ts.snap) or [graphql codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/other/add) do for example
              - if you want to ignore the errors, but cant change the file output, you should find the `.eslintignore` file at the root of the repository and write a globe pattern to ignore this (and potentially other, new) generated file
              - if you want to fix the errors and can access the code generator's source, you could use the [ESLint API](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/integrate/nodejs-api) as part of the generation process to fix the issues.
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>The reported error is in a file I haven't touched. What should I do?</summary>

              Someone might have bypassed the branch protection rules, and committed a file with lint errors to master. The best you can do is to create a new PR with only the lint fixes, and notify everyone else in the [slack channel]() about it. After that PR gets merged, you can merge master into this PR, and the lint errors will be solved.
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>I didn't see these errors in my IDE, is there a way to see them there?</summary>

              Of course! If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), download the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and then reload your IDE. You might also want to read [the documentation about how to install every recommended extension]().
              If you still can't see the lint errors in the IDE, contact **Zoltan Lehoczky**, and he will help:)

              You can also add the following configuration to your [user's setting.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) file, to auto-fix errors on save:

              ```json
              {
                "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
                  "source.fixAll.eslint": true,
                }
              }
              ```
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>I think one of the rules should be turned off, because it doesn't make sense to use it. Who should I contact?</summary>

              You can suggest turning a rule off in the [#frontend]() channel. Make sure to describe your arguments against the rules, and link other sources with the information if you can:)
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>I think this message can be improved. Who should I tell my ideas?</summary>

              You can post your improvement idea in the [#frontend]() channel, we will make sure to respond, and take your suggestions seriously;)

            ### <img src="https://api.iconify.design/logos:prettier.svg" height="24" align="top" /> Formatting Errors Found ‚ùå

            You can do one of the following things to solve the issue, feel free to choose based on which one is more convenient for you:
            - run `npm run format:fix` locally and commit the changes
            - if you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), open the files with the errors, open the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_command-palette) and run the `Format Document` command
            - type `/ci-autofix-format` as comment to this PR and a workflow will automatically fix the formatting for you and commit the changes to the PR

            _Frequently Asked Questions ‚ùî_

            <details>
              <summary>Why do I see this message?</summary>

              We use a formatter for our source code, called [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). For each PR we run this formatter as part of a CI job to make sure every file is formatted with it. You see this message, because one of the files in this PR's branch is not formatted.
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>Why do we use a formatter?</summary>

              You can read a lot of articles on the internet about why having a code formatter is beneficial. Probably the best place to start is prettier's own website: [prettier - why-prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/why-prettier).

              Here are some quotes from the website:

              > ‚ÄúWe want to free mental threads and end discussions around style. While sometimes fruitful, these discussions are for the most part wasteful.‚Äù

              > ‚ÄúOur top reason was to stop wasting our time debating style nits.‚Äù

              > ‚ÄúI want to write code. Not spend cycles on formatting.‚Äù
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>One of the files with formatting issues is autogenerated. What should I do?</summary>

              You have a few options:
              - if you have access to the code generator's source code, you could use the [Prettier API](https://prettier.io/docs/en/api) as part of the code generation process. This is similar to what people using [graphql codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/other/add) do for example
              - if you can't change the code generation's process to call prettier as part of it, you can add a glob pattern to the `.prettierignore` file, which is located at the root of the repository.
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>The reported error is in a file I haven't touched. What should I do?</summary>

              Someone might have bypassed the branch protection rules, and committed an unformatted file to master. The best you can do is to create a new PR with only the formatting changes, and notify everyone else in the [slack channel]() about it. After that PR gets merged, you can merge master into this PR, and the formatting errors will be solved.
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>Can this formatting be done automatically by my IDE?</summary>

              Of course! If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), download the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and then reload your IDE. You might also want to read [the documentation about how to install every recommended extension]().

              After that, VSCode will use prettier as the default formatter. See how formatting works in vscode by vitising their website: [vscode - formatting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting).

              We also recommend you to enable formatting on file saves by adding the following configuration to your [user's setting.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings):

              ```jsonc
              {
                "editor.formatOnSave": true,
                // format on paste can be annoying, feel free to disable or enable it.
                "editor.formatOnPaste": false,
              }
              ```
            </details>
